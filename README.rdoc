== DESCRIPTION

RFuseFS is a port of the FuseFS[https://rubygems.org/gems/rfusefs]
library aimed at allowing Ruby programmers to quickly and easily create
virtual filesystems with little more than a few lines of code.

RFuseFS is api compatible with FuseFS (0.7.0)

== SYNOPSIS

FuseFS provides a layer of abstraction to a programmer who wants to create a
virtual filesystem via FUSE.

FuseFS programs consist of two parts:

1. FuseFS, which is defined in 'rfusefs.rb'
2. An object that defines a virtual directory by implementing some
   subset of the {FuseFS::API} 

To write a FuseFS program, you must:

* Define and create a Directory object that responds to the methods required
  by FuseFS for its desired use.

* Call FuseFS.start <mountpoint> <virtualdir>
  where <mountpoint> is a real directory on your filesystem
  and <virtualdir> with an object defining your virtual directory.

See samples under /samples and also the following starter classes

* {FuseFS::MetaDir}
* {FuseFS::DirLink}
* {FuseFS::PathMapperFS}

To use the filesystem open up your favourite file browser/terminal and
explore the contents under <mountpoint>

Happy Filesystem Hacking!

=== the hello world filesystem in 14 LOC

  require 'rfusefs'

  class HelloDir
    def contents(path)
      ['hello.txt']
    end
    def file?(path)
      path == '/hello.txt'
    end
    def read_file(path)
      "Hello, World!\n"
    end
  end

  hellodir = HelloDir.new
  
  FuseFS.start(ARGV.shift,hellodir)
